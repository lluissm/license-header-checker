# license-header-checker

![Test Status](https://github.com/lluissm/license-header-checker/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

Multiplatform command line tool that **checks** whether the **license headers** are included in the **source files** of a project.

- It can **insert the license** to a file in case it does not exist (optional).
- It can **replace the license** of a file in case it is different from the target (optional).
- **Only the selected file extensions** will be **processed**.
- Specific **folders, files and paths can be ignored**.

_DISCLAIMER_

The tool looks for the keywords `license` or `copyright` inside the **first block comment of the file** to determine whether the file contains a valid license.

The block comment should be following the format `/* */`. Thus, while it does support the source files of languages like _Go, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Swift, Kotlin and C#_, it does not support the file extensions that do not use this comment style.

Go build tags (or anything that is not a block comment that could be before the license) are respected when **replacing** the license.
